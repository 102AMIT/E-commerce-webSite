<!-- Backend -->

<!-- why that project is scalable and modular also support dry principle -->

<!-- So Here we are using Error handler class for Internal error that is implemented in middleware/error.js -->

<!-- centralized Error handling for Db operation or async error by this we don't need to use try catch block everywhere that is implemented in middleware/error.js -->

<!-- Uncaught error handling -->

<!-- Wrong Mongoose ObjectId error (When we are passing Wrong Id in Url or params)  -->


<!-- In utils folder - > apiFeatures, I'm adding search, filter and pagination .Using search we are passing query String and by this query string we can find out all the products by matching characters and same with filter . -->
